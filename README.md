My name is Cole Silva and I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Chicago studying Economics with a 
specialization in Data Science and Statistics. I have some of the projects I've worked on outside of the 
classroom uploaded on my GitHub page publicly, but I also have a few more projects privately uploaded due to
guidelines from the University of Chicago. These privately uploaded projects include an A-Star Pathfinding
algorithm in C, a autocomplete engine using tries in C, a linear regression model coded by hand in Python, 
plus some other cool projects! If you'd like to see any of these private projects, shoot me a message and I'll
share them with you.
